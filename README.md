# Rogue-pong
This project is a simple Pong clone to practice game programming patterns and build an engine.

Here I implemented some patterns like the update method, game loop, double buffer rendering, command, and input handler.

All objects are initialized in Game class. So if you want to follow the code, start there.

You can build using Gradle Task build. Running command `./grandlew build` in the project's root folder.

Also, it is possible to run the game using the command `./gradlew run` in the project's root folder.
