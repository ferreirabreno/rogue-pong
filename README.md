# rogue-pong
this project is a simple pong clone to practice game programming patterns and build engine 

Here I implemented some patterns like update method, game loop, double buffer rendering, command, and input handler.

In class Game all objects are initialized.

You can build using gradle task build. Running command  `./grandlew build` in the project's root folder.

Also, is possible to run the game running command `./gradlew run` in the project's root folder.
